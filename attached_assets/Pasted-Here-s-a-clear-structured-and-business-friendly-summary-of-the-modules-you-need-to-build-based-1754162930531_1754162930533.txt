Here's a clear, structured, and business-friendly **summary of the modules** you need to build based on the customer requests. This version is optimized for planning, documentation, and briefing your technical or product teams.

## 🔧 MODULE SUMMARY FOR CUSTOMERS’ REQUESTS

### 1. 🤖 **Assistants Module (AI Widget for Customer Support)**

#### ✅ **Description:**

The **Assistants Module** allows customers to create **AI-powered, embeddable chat widgets** that can be deployed on their websites. Each assistant can interact with visitors in real-time, answer product- and project-related inquiries, collect lead data, and improve customer service.

#### 🧩 **Key Features:**

* Create multiple assistants, each with:

  * A unique embeddable widget code
  * Scope definition: **Tenant-wide** or **Workspace-specific**
  * Access control to **Products** and **Projects** within scope
  * Ability to ingest and use **custom data** per assistant
* Conversational lead capture:

  * Assistant asks visitors for contact details
  * Stores them in a dedicated `assistant_prospects` table to avoid CRM pollution
* Natural AI-like responses using project and product context (PostHog-style event learning to improve over time)

#### 📌 Use Case Example:

> A supermarket embeds an assistant on their website. It answers questions like “What’s on offer today?” or “Do you have sugar in stock?” using live product data from their workspace.

### 2. 🛍️ **Products Module (Cross-Industry Product Management)**

#### ✅ **Description:**

The **Products Module** allows businesses to manage and showcase products or services that they offer. It is **generic enough to work across industries**, supporting real estate, legal, retail, etc.

#### 🧩 **Key Features:**

* Manage all product-related data:

  * `products` table – with support for different fields including:

    * `is_featured` – highlight specific products
    * `workspace_id` – support multi-branch management
  * `product_types` – classify products by type (e.g. physical, digital, service)
  * `product_categories` – support filtering and organizing products
  * `product_offers` – define time-limited or conditional offers per product
* Integrated directly with **Assistant Module** as a data source
* Products menu will be separate from “Setup” and only accessible by **Inventory Manager** role
* Optionally support future inventory tracking extensions

#### 📌 Use Case Example:

> A legal firm lists their services as “products” – e.g., “Contract Drafting,” “Litigation Support.” A real estate firm lists plots and houses as products. Offers can be applied like “10% off on legal consultation this week.”
