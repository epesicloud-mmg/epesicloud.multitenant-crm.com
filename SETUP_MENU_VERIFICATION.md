## 📝 Notes

### What Was Fixed:
1. ✅ **Interest Levels** - Was completely empty (0 records), now has 5 relevant real estate interest levels
2. ✅ All other Setup items already had data from previous seeding

### If Cancellation Reasons Shows Empty in UI:
The database has 4 cancellation reasons. If the page shows empty:
1. **Refresh your browser** - Clear cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Re-login** - Your JWT token may have expired (tokens expire after 15 minutes)
3. **Check browser console** - Look for any 401 Unauthorized errors
